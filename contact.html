    We're here to help, so we've compiled a list of helpful FAQs below. Don't see the info you need? Our Support team can be reached seven days a week by clicking the handy orange button on the bottom right that says "Support."

Please include your username when emailing the team as it will help them resolve your issue even faster — and if you're not sure of your username, just look on the bottom left of the screen.

Our goal is to help you as soon as possible, within 2 business days or less. If you submitted a request via the Support button on our site, you won't get an auto-response from us, but rest assured we got your message and are on it!

Important to note: In order to make sure you receive email responses from us, please add  to your safe senders list now, and take it out of the “Promotions” tab in Gmail if it happens to find its way in there. ( for each email client.) If it's been more than two days and you can't find a response from us, please email  again. We'll figure out what's going on and get you back on track!

We appreciate your patience and look forward to taking care of you. You can also check for updates and announcements on Twitter .
